The main code for the paper *"The interplay between multifractal characteristics and seasonal fluctuations within the LNG spot freight market: insights, forecasting, and trading strategies"* is provided. The paper can be accessed at: [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11071-024-10343-1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11071-024-10343-1).

The code primarily focuses on the forecasting and quantitative trading aspects based on multifractal analysis. We have also included a Jupyter Notebook to help you to play and experiment with the implementation.
